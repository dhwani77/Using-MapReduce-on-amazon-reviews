The designs in this book are sophisticated enough to allow endless perturbations of complex designs, but not too intricate to require the skills of only the most accomplished artists. Noble brings out \"the artist in you\" through this terrific book.There are 24 patterns in the booklet, each of which is printed on matte white recycled paper stock. The paper surface is slightly on the rough side, probably owing to its recycled paper process, but smooth enough not to disrupt the coloring process. I\\'ve used four types of pencils on it, which have the following characteristics on the pages:Sanford Prismacolor Premier Colored Pencil Set, 72/Tin with New Colors: superb color laydown, rich, creamy, deepKoh-i-noor Progresso - 24 Woodless Coloured Pencils. 8758: thick, deep, solid, extremely creamy, more difficult to stay in linesLuminance 6901 Colour Pencil Set Of 38: more precise, with less thickness of color, but good shades of lighter colorPrismacolor Verithin Colored Pencils, 24 Colored Pencils(2427): extremely precise, but difficult to do anything other that lay outlines (which is their purpose, anyway)In sum, I can say this is an excellent booklet for anyone wishing to explore with colors, patterns, and shapes. The results can be simply stunning (see my sample photos I\\'ve uploaded, along with the many other samples which others have uploaded, too).  Five stars!',\n",

However, this product could have been a bit better if they had been printed on one sided paper. (or even paper that was a bit thicker) It is impossible to use paints or markers on these pages, and crayons would be entirely too wide to use effectively due to the very small spaces on a good deal of the designs.. I don't mind using colored pencils, so I'm not completely disappointed, but the ability to use markers without serious bleed-through would have made this product worth five stars. All in all, this is definitely best for an older child or adult, especially if they love coloring with pencils and/or like intricate patterns.\",\n",

The pegs  fit too loosely into the bench and he does not even use his hammer to pound them in, as he can  just push them in with his hand, or sometimes they fall through automatically.  My suggestion is to make the pegs fit a little tighter so the kids can learn skills of coordination, etc when pounding them in.  The pegs are nice and thick for little hands, but just not snug enough fitting to really use the toy as it is intended,',\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"Twirled Paper is a fabulous book for anyone who is interested in learning paper quilling. It comes with everything you need to get started - paper, a quilling tool, glue and even googly eyes to add to your creations! It also has instructions on all the types of coils you can make and lots of tips on how to make different shapes with them.There are detailed instructions on creating all different kinds of insects, fish, farm animals, pets, birds and even aliens. Once you get started it is easy to let your imagination roam free and use the images inside as inspiration to create your own pictures. Quilling is fiddly to get the hang of but this book starts with such simple instructions that it doesn't take too long to get to grips with it and then you can move on to some of the more complicated designs included.If you've ever wanted to have a go at making your own cards then I'd highly recommend this book, it has enough paper to complete a few different projects and you can easily buy more from any craft shop. This book is a great resource for beginners and people who have been quilling for a while. I've had it for years now and it's the kind of book I dip into every couple of years when I'm in the mood to do something creative.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"I found out about this card game after many months playing another card game online called Shadow Era that is run by the company who made Healing Blade. Besides Shadow Era, I've been a fan of other card games including Magic: The Gathering and Warlords and thought this particular set would make a perfect surprise gift for a boyfriend who is into medicine and pathology.As for the product itself, there's nothing bad to say. It comes well packaged in a nice small box with both decks (diseases and medicines), the artwork is amazing, and you get some little glass pebble counters and full color playmats to help you remember where everything goes. It's a nice package that I was happy to receive for the price I paid.The gameplay itself still needs fine tuning but as another reviewer mentioned, the makers of the game are potentially working on a revision to the game play rules which would take this product all of the way to a five star rating for me. Right now I've found that basically if you are playing the Medicine/Hero side of the game, you've basically got the game won if you don't die in the early rounds. There seems to be no real game changing effects that help bring you back on the Disease/Villain side of the game if you end up with more high cost cards than you can afford to play. It makes the gameplay stall out at a certain point where you both just keep doing nothing on a turn, and if the Disease-Team doesn't do anything, there's nothing for the Medicine-Team to respond to. So you end up just waiting, and going through the motions with no opportunity to make a big come-back.If you've played similar card games on your own, you can probably make a few revisions on the fly to improve your game play experience.At first, if you aren't a medical student, it's probably going to be hard for you to remember the cards that are in play and what they relate to. After awhile it gets easier though, and medical students will probably have a blast with this.Even with the current issue with the gameplay rules, it's worth buying and either tweaking the play style yourself or getting familiar with until they release a new revision to the rules.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'The Healing Blade is a game about battling infectious diseases. Yes, you read that right. It is a two player game where one side plays the Lord of Pestilence (the diseases) and another plays the Apothecary Healers (the medicinal agents for countering the diseases). It was developed by two medical doctors who also happen to be gamers, Francis Kong and Arun Mathews. From what I\\'ve read, it is growing in popularity with medical students.When I first heard about this, the first thing I thought of was an academic paper my wife had ran across and told me about by Richard Steinman and Mary Blastos called \"A trading-card game teaching about host defence\" from 2002. The paper concluded concluded that the game was super-effective for teaching the concepts. The two are unrelated, to my knowledge, but share the same conceptual space. Both the game in the paper and The Healing Blade are games... that teach. But on to this game.It\\'s a beautiful game. It has high-quality components, and great art. There are 20 green glass beads included to track the energy resource used, ATP (adenosine triphosphate). Each player has a full-color playmat. And most of the 90 cards have unique art. The art is definitely worth mentioning here... it would definitely hold its own against Magic: The Gathering art. Gorgeous illustratiuons. Altogether, a very impressive set of components.And then... the cards. Okay, here is where the diseases come in. Each Lord of Pestilence card has the full scientific name of the disease (Streptococcus pneumoniae or Helicobacter pylori, as examples), its abbreviated common name (S. pneumoniae, H. pylori) and a fantasy-style piece of art that represents it, plus flavortext that puts a magical spin on its real-world effect. Each Apothecary Healer card has the name of a medicine (ie, Doxycyclene) and its own art and flavortext. Aside from a small font, they are very well put together.As for gameplay... let\\'s say that this was the funnest study session I\\'ve ever had on infectious diseases. Which is to say that as a game, the mechanics do leave a little to be desired. The rules are pretty concise and simple, but in playing we found a couple situations not covered in the rules. For instance, as the Lord of Pestilence, I found my hand of cards clogged with high-cost diseases that I was unable to play. The result was that my Apothecary Healer opponent was able to build up and have a healer combatant that could counter most diseases I could play. It could have just been a bad run, and I noticed on their site a rules revision is in progress. So... the current gameplay isn\\'t tight, mechanics-wise... but as I see it, that\\'s not an issue. Because mechanics are not the point.What this game represents is a great step in the right direction for games that teach. If I were a medical student, I would absolutely love this game. This beats the heck out of a dry textbook. Granted, it doesn\\'t replace the textbook, but it is a great supplement that presents the material in a way that activates different parts of the brain. This would be a great supplement to a class on pathogens. It slaps a fun theme on the subject of infectious diseases and how to fight them, and runs with it. I hands-down recommend this for any med student out there. For gamers? Not so much. But keep your eye out: the next rules revision may very well put this mechanically closer to the games we play just for fun. I suspect we may start seeing more hobby-quality games whose primary purpose is to help us learn. And I like that!',\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'The most disappointing this about this game is how little the beautiful artwork and fantasy is used to augment the learning. The drugs are all impressive looking fantasy heroes, and the microbes are all scary demons, but the form, setting, weaponry, etc. that each takes is almost entirely arbitrary, which can be confusing and is a huge missed opportunity to make learning easier.For example, Ciprofloxacin and Levofloaxcin are two related drugs that have some subtle but important differences. But from the way that they\\'re depicted on the cards, you\\'d never guess they had anything to do with each other. Levo is a man wearing green armor standing in a green wooden background carrying a spear with blades on the end. Cipro is a woman in a blue and pink dress carrying a short dagger on a largely white and pink background. In fact, Cipro ends up looking at lot like Metronidazole, Ampicillin, and Tetracycline, which creates a clear visual linkage between 4 drugs that really couldn\\'t be more different.You might also think that Imipenem/cilastin, an extremely broad-spectrum combination therapy that is described as \"Elite warriors!\" on the card, might look particularly imposing. But no, they look just like all the others. The microbes are only a little better. F. tularensis looks like a rabbit, but why antrhax is a dragon surrounded by firey butterflies, I have no idea. You also might think they\\'d make the gram positive bugs have purple themed cards and the negatives red, but no, it\\'s often the opposite, which again creates confusing visual associations that I\\'d have had to consciously reverse.The list goes on and on. This is a great concept that could be fixed with a major artwork overhaul, but for the moment, there\\'s plenty to learn in microbiology without associating every bug and drug with an unrelated fantasy character.',\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'WayWord: 2-4 Players, Ages 10+, Average Play Time = 30-60 MinutesLike my experience with \"Got It!\", I really like how flexible this game allows you to be.  You can add more tiles to the twenty-four you are initially alloted, so as long as it works out that each player would receive an equal amount of turns.  If you have four players for example, you could add twenty-eight or thirty-two tiles instead.  You can opt to play a longer game, or you can play the standard game which lasts about an hour, sometimes less, depending on how quick players are in forming words.The variant listed in the manual is a welcome addition to the main game and was received well by my son and me.  It gave us more options in the beginning, as we were often struggling to find words using the normal setup.  The variant also suggests the use of a sand timer (not included in the main game) to help speed things along, which is a good idea if you are pressed for time.  I normally leave out timers in the games we review to encourage the kids to think about all of their options.Since there are seventy-one tiles and you are using less than a third of them in each game, the replay value ends up being extremely high.  Add the fact that you have pawns blocking each other\\'s movements and bonus tiles that provide various effects...two games end up never being the same.Aside from its replayability, it is very educational.  This game forces players to expand their vocabulary and adapt to the letters that they are presented with.  This would be an excellent game for kids as it promotes learning and creative thinking.  Using this game as a practice aid for spelling and vocabulary in the classroom is very doable.  The teacher (or parent) could pick and choose which twenty-four tiles are in the game, based on the kinds of words that they are practicing at the time.My son struggled at first, not understanding the difference between laying a tile down and starting a word where the pawn was.  He quickly came to see after a few turns however that you can strategically place your letter tiles in such a way that your pawn could utilize it.  The game went very quickly (about thirty minutes) and we tied at fifty-nine points each.  For our first game, I stacked the \"deck\" with more greens and yellows to help ease him into learning the game.  He was trying out different letter combinations and sometimes asked if what he proposed was a word...which is exactly the kind of interaction that I was hoping would result from playing together.  He was being encouraged to think outside of the box and expand his vocabulary...a plus for any parent worth his (or her) two cents.Overall, this is an excellent game to introduce to your family on family game night.  Its high replayability allows for hours of fun, while keeping your mind and vocabulary sharp in the process.',\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'Why surprising?  Because it was a \"free with your order\" game I received and therefore didn\\'t expect much.There are a bunch of hex pieces, each with a letter on them.  Depending upon common frequency of the letter, it has 1 to 3 points.  A number of tiles are randomly set up to start the game.  During his/her turn, each player tries to make a word using the tiles in play, but only by \"walking\" his/her token from tile to tile.  For example, \"BET\" is a word only if the \"E\" is adjacent to both the B and the T!  The word must start from the tile the token is currently at, and if a tile is currently covered by another token, it may not be used in the word.  You will quickly hate your co-players, believe me.  \"Why did you have to end on the S tile?\" \"Sure, block the only E on the board.  Thanks.\"To add to gameplay, some tiles are special, allowing the player who walks on them in the midst of his/her word to jump elsewhere on the board, double or triple the points for the word, or other goodies.  After a given number of turns (depending upon player count), the highest score wins.We play this regularly, and it continues to baffle us while putting smiles on our faces.  Winning this game gives a player a true sense of accomplishment!',\n",

The pages are coated but not in hard board book style (as I anticipated) but for the purposes of allowing the stickers to be stuck and then peeled off and repositioned, they work very well. The set comes with three sheets of stickers that match the design of the album - each double page spread has a different scene - and they are awesome. The stickers are &#34;puffy&#34; like what I remember of stickers in the 80s but they don't rip or become damaged otherwise when you try and peel them off to reposition them in order to create scenes. I expect that it will take a reasonable amount of time for my 5 yo daughter to fill up the pages but there are two more designs of this sticker album from Sticker Farm and I fully intended to get the other ones if/when my daughter fills up this book. I balked at the price initially but this set has been well worth the money.\",\n",

They love stickers and have some favorites they would like to save.  Most I have seen have been flimsy paper pages similar to a booklet and not something you would save a collection in.  This sticker book is big, with a padded hard cover and lots of colorful thick pages inside.  Also a clear vinyl page/pouch in the back for sharing or saving sheets of stickers!!  Well worth the price, as this is for a collection and will last their childhood!  The pages are coated so you can restick the stickers.  It would probably depend on the type of sticker you are using if it can be repositioned.  Sticker Farm sells adorable stickers too that restick very well.  Check out their website:[...]  and they are on Facebook too.  I highly recommend this sticker book!  If my kids fill their books up, I will order more!  They love that they have a place to put their favorite stickers and enjoy looking through the book at them!\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"Since getting into gaming for real with the hobby and as a school teacher, I've becoming very passionate about using games as an educational tool both in and out of the classroom. I've written an extensive session report on how to use Twilight Struggle in the classroom based on a class project a few years back and have been as outspoken as possible every where I can to pursue the use of other good games for the same reason. Perhaps because of this, a while ago I was approached by the makers of this game to play and review it.(I did receive a complimentary copy to do so)This is my first board game review, so please bear with me. In order to do so, I wanted to take advantage of playing with the target audience of the game--my 17 1/2 year old nephew who's a good kid, does well in school, but is very apathetic about pretty much everything, including getting ready and applied to college.Components: The game comes in a fairly small, compact box and has good quality card stock cards. The artwork and colors are very utilitarian and have a good education look that is nice and I enjoy it. You will need a bunch of paper clips on hand as these are used to track info on the cards. I'd recommend plastic or coated ones so as not to scrape up the cards any as you slide them up and down.The Basic Premise: The goal of Application Crunch is just that, to show high school students the process of how to apply to college in a way that makes sense, is fun and interesting. It's played over a series of rounds using cards and action points in a variety of ways to track the progress of the players in multiple facets of their high school life and 'sending' those trackers off to achieve different rewards, ultimately resulting in applying and hopefully being accepted at the type of college you believe will bring you the most victory points.How it Works: To start, everyone draws a character card, a family finances card and two envelopes. Each character has a special ability to give them a slight leg up in different aspects of the game. Each player in turn draws a productivity card telling them how many action points they get along with some fun, light flavor text in the mood of a typical HS kid's week. The player then uses those action points to either draw cards, move up a level on the cards they already have, or add cards to your envelopes and/or add the envelopes to an event or college (thus 'applying' to that school).The cards are divided into extracurricular, academics, work, and service along with question cards which work a little differently. Each of these activities have levels and theme appropriate names that provide benefits for achieving them. The higher up, the better and more versatile--more cash, awards, etc. This is where the paper clips are used to track that information. The question cards are drawn and asked by the active player. These are open ended trivia-type questions about getting ready for college and/or applying. A few answers are on each card but I'd say it's pretty much up to the group which are best and who should get the rewards, usually a free level up.After all players have taken all their actions, a new event or college is put into play to be applied to and the last one in the line is set aside. Those whose envelopes were submitted to that event/college are opened and its determined who were admitted and/or given other awards.Once all events/colleges have gone through this process, the game is over and you determine who won. You have to have enough money to go to the college you end up selecting that you got into. Each college gives you victory points according to the different icons you achieved and which school you went to. So, a technical school will give you more points for awards in engineering and science while a private school will emphasize high grades.Whoever has the most points is the winner.My take: The game was surprisingly cohesive and enjoyable and my nephew felt the same way. You learn much about the application process and what it entails to get into the college of your choice. The game is fairly quick and simple but has many interesting decisions to make. I liked how it showed how you need to balance your life between, academics, work and extracurricular activities. The trivia cards are great, too, as they can start good discussions about what to expect and what needs to be done. However, I do think they would work much better with 3-4 players. The icons were easy to read and the rules are fairly easy to follow. The end game scoring is a bit of math, but that's good anyway, right?Overall, Application Crunch is a well designed game that achieves its purpose in that it is both informative/educational and fun to play. My nephew and I both agree that it would not be our first, second or third choice to play off the game shelf as it really isn't that kind of fun. However, to be used for its intended purpose, it gets high marks.

I was excited because our kids love games and we are always trying to teach them about the college process. At first it was a little complicated to start but after two or three rounds my students were hooked. They got competitive when applying for colleges and really understood the ideas of what they needed to do to be eligible for college. I found the connections to the real college application process pretty on point. Overall we really loved it.My only down points, if you can really call them that, were that the game took a long time to play the first time because we all were learning it but the kids didn't seem to mind and it got quicker as we got better. Also you can only have 4 players at a time which was hard when I wanted to play with a whole class.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"Application Crunch game comes in a small box full of cards that suppose teach you the process of college application process, does it do the job? Let's find out together.When you first open the box, you will see a small rule book and a sheet that teach you how to set the game up in detail, this is a plus from the get go since they don't want to confuse you from the beginning.This game is played in 15 rounds, a player has to balance his time/action between work, service, extracurricular, and/or academics to get a better chance of getting into the colleges he or she wants to go. While a person is balancing these 4 items, they are also competing with each other on scholarships and getting into selective schools that have very limited opening so they can maximize they point at the end of the game.One thing I like about this game the cards are not generic cards that simply says work, service, extracurricular,  academics, they actually have very detail description of what that role does, i,e, a SERVICE card says Volunteer Soup Kitchen, one could earn PERSONAL STORIES and LETTERS OF REC if he/she decide to put enough time into it and these elements are helpful in applying for colleges and/or scholarships later on in the game.Perhaps another WORK card says you are a LION TAMER could potentially earn you lots of MONEY, PERSONAL STORIES and LETTER OF REC. A EXTRACURRICULARS card could be MODERN DANCE, SNOWBOARDING, ULTIMATE FRISBEE or a GAME design.You get the idea of this game, so is this a good game? I would say this is a great tool for those student just enter high school in their 9th and 10th grade who can prepare their college application process early. Although you can play this game in less than an hour but when you are actually preparing in real life will take a couple of years to build your portfolio to apply for colleges.And did I mention the maker of this game is University of Southern California ??? That should give you a hint how content rich this game is.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'Disclaimer - I did receive a complimentary copy of this game from the publisher.Application Crunch is a game designed to teach students about the process of applying to college.  The game consists of cards, a quick set up guide, a rule book, and some envelopes.  You will need to provide some paperclips in order to play.  I was impressed by the components.  The cards are good quality, nicely designed, and easy to read.  I liked the colors and the layout of the cards.The one issue that I had with components is that you will be putting paper clips on your cards and moving them up and down.  We used metal paper clips and this scratched the cards.  This doesn\\'t really affect game-play; it\\'s more of an aesthetics issue.  I would make sure that you use plastic or coated paper clips when you play.The goal of the game is to apply to different colleges throughout the game.  At the end of the game you will decide which college to attend based on which colleges accepted you.  After you decide which college to attend you will score points based on how you played throughout the game.  The player with the most points wins.At the beginning of the game everyone draws a character card and a family finances card.  The different characters give special abilities.  For example, the die hard can take five actions when he draws a card that only gives him 3 actions.  Your family finance card can give you some bonus cash to start with.Each turn you draw a productivity card that tells you how many action points you will have.  The cards have amusing flavor text, such as the Up Late Gaming Card; \"It\\'s 3am - time to put down the controller.\"  The productivity cards all have what actions can be used for printed on them, which was a nice touch.Actions are used to do many things.  You can draw activity cards.  The activity cards are divided into extracurricular, academics, work, and service.  You can also use an action to level up one of your activity cards.  This is just like leveling up a planeswalker in Magic, the Gathering.  Each activity card has different levels to it.  Some of the levels have icons that represent letters of recommendations, good grades, money, or other bonuses.  To level up a card you spend the actions that it specifies on the card and you move your paper clip up that level.Actions can also be used to draw question cards.  You read the question to all of the players and let them answer it.  The questions are all related to college, such as \"What is the difference between AA, BA, and BS degrees?\"  When you ask a question you get to level up an academic card one level.  You also get to decide which player had the best answer to the question and they also get to level up an academic card.  The question cards have answers to the questions printed on them, so that kids can compare the answers they hear with what\\'s on the card.You can also use actions to put cards in your application envelopes and to put your envelope next to a college or event.  There is a series of cards that come out during the game.  These represent colleges and other things, such as college fairs and financial aid.  To apply for these things you use an action to \"submit\" an envelope next to one.  Every turn you look through the envelopes of the players that applied to that school to see who got in.At the end of the game everyone looks through the schools that they were accepted to and decides which one to attend.  You must have acquired enough money to pay for that school by the end of the game.  You then calculate your score based on how you have leveled up your cards throughout the game.  Each school gives you points depending on how many icons you have earned throughout the game.  For example art school will give points for cards that have levels of fine art, while the selective state school gives more points for academics.I played a two player game with a friend who likes Eurogames.  The game is for 3-4 players but we were just trying to figure out how everything worked.  We found that the mechanics worked together well.  My friend liked how asking a question was a good way to game the system, as you could level up a card for one action when some cards required two actions to level up.I played another game with the same friend and two high school students.  One student was a senior and had already applied and been accepted to college.  The other student was a sophomore and hasn\\'t started applying to schools.  Both students said that this wasn\\'t the kind of game that they would choose to play for fun.  However, they both said that they enjoyed playing it and that it taught them a lot about the application process.  They said that it showed how one had to be well rounded and balance things like academics and work.  They also really seemed to enjoy the question cards, which brought up some good discussion.Things I really liked about the game:I liked the leveling up mechanic.I liked the little envelopes.  My 5 year old daughter almost ran away with them when she saw them.I liked how the game forces you to think about different aspects of applying to college.  You are forced to look at your money situation, grades, service activities, and the like.  The students I played with said that it was eye opening to see that they had to focus on so many different things when looking into college.I would recommend this game to anyone who works with college bound students.  Playing the game can be a great springboard for discussion.  I liked how the game made the students think concretely about something that can seem abstract and distant.  College seemed almost like a myth when I was in high school.  It was something that I would eventually go to and that was all I really thought about it.  This game does a good job of providing hooks for students to use when thinking about college.  They can gain some insight to navigating the application process.  Any game that can be fun and teach  at the same time is a good game in my opinion.',\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'I received a copy of Application Crunch to play with my academic game club and went into it with somewhat low expectations. In my experience, games that are specifically designed to be educational often lack any actual gameplay.Thankfully, this was not the case with Application Crunch. The game plays with a very \"Eurogame\" feel with cards dictating the number of actions you get each turn. Each player also has a character class, which is essentially a high school clique stereotype that gives that player a small advantage for performing various actions.Overall my students and I enjoyed the game. It had a surprising amount of decisions to be made while still playing quickly and not leading to any kind of over-analysis that can bog down a game. It also very much gave a feel of that senior year rush when a student has 20 things they want to do and only 4 hours of free time. All that was conveyed well and drove home the importance of prioritizing.So overall, this game is a fantastic recommendation for a high school club - or even better a guidance office. The only drawback is it still has a deck of cards that ask questions about preparing for college. That gives it the scent of \"educational\" game that scares off many of my kids from voluntarily playing it when they are faced with an entire cabinet of choices.So I would rate it 5 stars as an educational game. And 4 stars as a game where education isn\\'t the primary goal.',\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'Let begin this game review with a confession. I feel abused after playing it. the abuse was both mental and physical. I would go so far as to call it torture. I was the victim of a lot of Kickstarter hype and got suckered into buying it. Never again.Tammany hall is an area control Game. The very attractive board is a map of old NY with all the wards in various shades of earth tones. Each of up to 5 players has a pile of \"Bosses\" that they place in wards each turn to influence the immegrant community to vote for them in an election. There are 4 different Imigrant groups: German, English, Irish and Italian. All the groups except the Italians are on the board at set up. All are randomly placed except the Irish are in Tammany Hall. Game turns are seperated into 4 Terms of 4 years each. Each turn You choose to place two Bosses in wards of your choice or a Boss and one immegrant cube from a group randomly chosen from a bag and placed in on the board representing those straight off the boat. The cube comes with a political favor chip of the same color that you will use to vote during the election phase that comes at the end of each 4 year term. The object of the game is to win elections and dominate the most wards in order to get victory points and more political favor chips by having the most of any immigrant group in your Wards. Elections take place in a ward order marked by arrows on the board. If a ward is contested the players with bosses in that ward engage in a blind ballot using the political favor chips they have accumulated as votes. (Note: there is NO auction or bidding in the game as stated in the Amazon discription) they can only use the color that is represented by the immigrants present in the ward at the time of the election. The winner gets the ward for scoring and all other bosses are removed from that ward. The person who wins the most wards after an election gets to be the Mayor who then gets to assign city jobs to the rest of the players that give them certain powers that affect the game. For example; the police chief can arrest any immirgrant anywhere once per year. Then there is the power to slander. players get 3 slander chips that they can use to remove other bosses in the course of the game at the rate of 1 per term.All of this probably sounds pretty cool and to be honest the Theme kind of works through its abstraction. But it\\'s a vicious, nasty game where you are forced into backstabbing conflict. Now normally I would love that but the problem is that the game has no balance at all. One or two bad first moves in the game will sentence a player to 90 minutes of frustrating tedium with no hope of recovery because the game doesn\\'t give you a mechanism to recover. If you can\\'t win wards you can\\'t get favor chips by having the most immigrants and without favor chips you have no votes. Because territory is tight you are forced into conflicts you can\\'t win for no good reason because your options when you are behind become so limited. You have to play your bosses somewhere. The word used most by my game group on breaking out this game was \"tedious\". It took way to long to play for what it is.I feel I should mention the quality and price as well. The art is nice though nothing that might require an art department and the board and box are of exceptional quality. I would go so far to say that it is overkill but The parts themselves seem pretty standard off the shelf chips and meeples though the meeples might be custom. The bottom line is you could get any map of anywhere and apply a similar theme ( maybe the Mafia in Sicily ) and buy a few components from a game store or use components from another game and create your own better game using the same mechanics. I buy a lot of games with way more components for a much lower price. I think a fair price for what you get would be on the order of 35 dollars delivered. But that being said, the game is too broken to pay any price. It will be quickly forgotten on your game shelf. the one redeeming quality it may have is that if you play this game with people you don\\'t like they will probably never contact you again.',\n",

It helps that many of the rules don't kick in until after everybody has taken four turns around the table.It is basically an occupy and hold game for 3 to 5 players, set in 19th Century New York City.  No dice, very little randomness, with elements of bluffing, negotiation, and intimidation.  You occupy wards with a combination of placing ward bosses, and backing them up with political favor tokens.  You earn political favors by bringing immigrants ashore and then organizing them in your wards. There are four immigrant groups, each player will try to control one or two of these groups as she battles to win mayoral elections over a 16-year period.Players can form alliances to beat up whoever is ahead, but if you devote too many resources to these political fights you may lose control of your own base and fall behind your consolidating competitors.Give it a try!\",\n",

Some even go so far as to accuse Tammany of connivance in this so-called rampant criminality. What am I to do? I can\\'t have this. Something has to be done.\"Tammany Hall is one of the simplest and one of the most viciously political games I have played. These two statements seem contradictory so let\\'s take a look.The Basics - \"You see this knife? I\\'m gonna teach you to speak English with this ****ing knife!\"Tammany Hall is a political control board game in which you play out the unprincipled battles for votes in New York in the late nineteenth century. Using muscle, political tricks and skullduggery you aim to crush your rival and emerge as the dominant political power in Old New York. To do this each turn you can either drop two heavies onto the board (to ensure votes come your way in a precinct) or drop one heavy and move some poor befuddled immigrants into an area (which gets you political influence).  See just a choice of two actions ... easy right?Well after four turns of this there\\'s an election to see who gets mayor (and lots of bonus points). The elections run ward by ward across the city and you win elections by counting up your heavies (who are guaranteed to \\'arrange\\' the vote for you) and blind bidding political influence chips. And this is it gets really, really fun. You stare your friends in the eye and casually explain how you will BURN them if they dare to try contesting the election. You calmly point out that if they fight you here they will lose the next wards they are fighting for and have NOTHING. They of course calmly counter that they have been so kind to the immigrants that their voting power is unassailably and you should beg forgiveness.  Then you reveal your hidden chips and the winners yells out in victory!The Twist - \"The appearance of law must be upheld, especially when it\\'s being broken.\"After the election the player with the most wards is declared mayor and scoops up enough victory points to cement their lead. Then they must assign political offices to each of the losers -- these offices are powerful in that they allow these coat-tail grabbing to cheat! To protect a ward from influence, to arrest (remove) immigrant populations, to provide free housing (move populations around) and even just rack in extra influence for doing nothing! And these scoundrels will use their political offices to tear you down -- you! the one who gave them the offices. Ungrateful curs!And More! - \"That, my friends, is the minority vote.\"You can slander an opponent forcing his heavies out of a ward and throwing their political machine into confusion. You can control an immigrant population and win even more influence. There are bonus wards which, when won, change the political landscape. Ah, it\\'s tricky rising to the top in old New York!The Play - \"If you get all of us together, we ain\\'t got a gang, we\\'ve got an army.\"It\\'s a really tight, really focused game. You never have resources to do what you want to do and the other players always have the ability to take down the leader.Now there is one problem in play in that if a player fails utterly in the early round it is impossible for them to catch up alone. And this is the key, the last player should parlay his status as a wild card (he has nothing to lose) to team up with the second player to take down the leader. If you work alone you are either the leader (and crushing all before you -- good luck with that) or you are missing opportunities to ally and snatch victory. Once you\\'ve learned to team up (like ragged hyenas) and then turn on your allies in an instant you\\'ve learned to play this game.The Box - \"Remember the first rule of politics. The ballots don\\'t make the results, the counters make the results. The counters. Keep counting.\"The components (box, board, meeples) are really nice. The only flaw is that you get a sheet of stickers to place on the political favor chips with the flag of the nation (Germany, England, Ireland, Italy) and that\\'s fiddly.Summary - \"Mulberry Street... and Worth... Cross and Orange... and Little Water. Each of the Five Points is a finger. When I close my hand it becomes a fist. And, if I wish, I can turn it against you.\"Our group started to use the phrase \"You\\'ve been Tammany Hall\\'d\" to describe when someone had been crushed in other games. This one is good enough, fun enough and vicious enough to infect other games. High praise indeed!',\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'This game has some great backstabbing fun. I recommend it for a group of competitive players who enjoy some healthy tension and getting political.It is important to note that it has a rather high skill cap and is the type of game in which the more experienced players can win pretty easily. They will understand the most advantageous locations to seek as well as the best way to use or distribute the city council powers. Less experienced players will have a tough time making the most of their very limited resources.Half of the fun is in the real world politics (appropriate for the theme). Forming alliances, and sometimes breaking them, is sometimes necessary to take out whoever is in the lead. Fights for territories can not be avoided, and they often occur between \"alliances.\" This constant conflict is by far the biggest reason why this game gets so tense. I get so nervous with each turn, that it can truly stress me out.In response to those who claim that the game is unbalanced and that it is impossible for one to \"bounce back\" after losing, I will admit that it is extremely difficult. However, it is certainly not impossible, and it does not mean that the \"loser\" will not have any fun. Let\\'s not forget that in many of these types of games, the loser (or losers) is the one who has the power to DECIDE who the winner is by dedicating all resources to screwing someone over or pushing them to victory.

It's great to start conversation with kids who just want to play a game and aren't super interested in talking. I even had one of my clients ask his mom to buy the game so they could play at home. My one complaint is that the cards are very big! It's hard for a lot of my kids to actually hold the cards since they're like supersized playing cards.\",\n",

I LOVE this game.  Previous reviewers commented on the size being a bit large and I agree. I even have trouble holding them.  The cards are repetitive and when the client comments about this, we have a discussion about how we sometimes get angry about the same thing so the cards are giving us the chance to come up with many ways to handle the same situation. I also use the cards with the parents and children.  This has been very valuable when the children see their parents admit their behavior is not always appropriate and they are working on their own anger.  I have combined this game with deep breathing.  They are getting rid of the &#34;Dragon's Breath&#34; as they exhale.  The kids love it and the parents can prompt them to practice the skill by j saying Dragon's Breath.\",\n",

It's much easier to swallow those imperfections when I only ended up spending $14.95 on the whole thing.BTW - the pieces themselves are quite sturdy and the boys were having a lot of fun with them.

I pick three different colors and let the child know at the beginning that every time someone draws one of those three colors they will also draw a Thoughts and Feelings Card.  It's a non threatening way to get quiet kiddos in particular to open up and share.  Once they give an answer I can explore the topic more with them if appropriate.  The only caution I might offer is that you might want to pre arrange the cards...During one game the first card we drew was &#34;Someone I know who has died is...&#34; This was kind of an intense start to the activity! Other than that, however, the cards offer a great starting point for deeper conversation.\",\n",

They allow children to open up in a playful way, and create wonderful conversation starters between kids and adults.  With my own child, they are a fun way to chat and learn new things about each other.  With kids and families in therapy, they create opportunities to assess needs and deepen relationships between family members, or between client and therapist.There are so many ways to use them, too!  You can just draw from the deck and shre, or you can pair these cards with another favorite game.  For example, I sometimes bring the cards out along with Checkers or Chess, and anytime someone loses a game piece to the other player, they draw a card and complete the sentence.  I have also paired the cards with Jenga, Don't Break the Ice, Candyland, Chutes and Ladders, and many other childhood games.Kids love the adorable artwork, and the fact that they can answer their own way makes these cards a non-threatening way to get to know someone new or deepen a relationship with someone trusted.I highly recommend this and other Bright Spots products to anyone with children from about age three (adults read the card aloud for the child) to adult.\",\n",

It was a good outlet for him and opened up the doors for further conversation in a safe and non-threatening manner.

It forces her to think about these questions and using the pictures as guides it makes her use her speech to construct sentences and phrases.Sounds really basic but there's something about flash colorful flash cards that really captures a child's attention.

The sentence stems and art in this second deck are so interesting and engaging, kids and adults alike can't help but want to play again and again.  I use these to get conversations started with people from age 3 all the way to adults because they apply regardelss of age.  The artwork draws in youger kids, of course, but the ideas the themes cut across age, gender, and generations.  Teens, especially,  find it easier to open up because each thought is started for them, and there is no right or wrong way to finish a sentence!  When a family plays the game, adults and kids open up their communication and find they can talk more easily to each other than they ever thought.  Of course the game can be paired with other games to make two-games-in-one (such as Checkers - pull a sentence completion card whenever you take an opponent's checker) and that makes this game well worth the price and a perfect way to enhance family game night.  The cards are bright and sturdy and will really last in the tough box.  Your imagination fuels all the ways to use these cards.

       "  'reviewText': \"I'm pretty skeptical of party games. For the most part, they're rehashed crap. Most of them could be played without actually having to buy anything, and most of the best party games don't require any components at all (like Truth or Dare, Have You Ever, or Quarters. OK, Quarters has components, but not many game companies are going to start selling rolls of quarters and pitchers of beer). The end result is that, while I see lots of party games, I don't tend to like very many of them.The Game of Things, from Hasbro, is one I like. In fact, it's one of the few I break out on a regular basis. It has the potential for a huge amount of hilarious fun, and it's equally playable with a room full of teenagers or a geriatric nursing home. Like nearly every party game ever, it relies on not playing with idiots to have fun, but I think that applies to nearly anything, from Risk to water-skiing (there are exceptions - it can be hilarious to play Red Light, Green Light with a retard).In Things (I'm abbreviating the name because I'm lazy), you've got a big deck of descriptions. These descriptions might be 'Things you would like to do with chocolate', or 'Things you would do if you could change genders for a day'. One person reads the description out loud, and everyone writes a thing that would be an answer, like 'eat it' or 'play Darjeeling.' Then you go around the table and take turns guessing who wrote what.Like most party games, the actual scoring is almost completely irrelevant. You don't really care who wins. The point is to hang out and have fun with people you may or may not like, unless you're playing with my father-in-law, in which case the point is to be as horribly inappropriate as possible (when asked for 'Things you wish you could check out in the library', he wrote 'the librarian'. In all fairness, I wrote 'whiskey and whores,' so it was kind of a tie for worst place).It's tough to write an in-depth review of a game as simple as The Game of Things. You read a card, everyone writes an answer, then you guess who wrote what. That's really it. It's not like there's strategy, outside playing like my son and writing answers that sound like someone else wrote them (like for 'Things cannibals think about while dining,' he wrote, 'I wish I had a good dark beer,' and everyone thought I wrote that. I wrote 'Mmm, tastes like chicken.') But even though it's not very deep, if you can get the right crowd of miscreants together, this can be a lot of fun. I've laughed myself through dozens of games of Things, although it's not always safe to play with kids (especially if you're playing with people who would answer 'Things you should not photograph' with 'your junk'. Like me).Apparently, Hasbro was trying to appeal to collector-types when they made The Game of Things, because it comes in a really nice wooden box. There's no reason it couldn't have come in a cardboard box like every other game, but the wooden slide-top box is a really nice touch. And the pretty box makes people think it must be better than other games, which it really is not, but they don't know that, so they'll play with you.On a scale that goes from Strip Spin the Bottle to Apples to Apples, The Game of Things falls somewhere around Taboo. It's a good time, but not as much fun as being 19 and getting naked with a roomful of pretty girls while you drink yourself into a stupor. But then, you can play Things with your in-laws, and if you play Strip Anything with your in-laws, please don't tell me about it.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'My four year old daughter pulled this out of a closet to play. It was the first time I had seen it and was pleasantly surprised by its colorful presentation of the characters in a Christmas atmosphere. The game play if fairly easy to understand, even for a 4 year old. Collect candy canes and \"gifts\" by landing on certain squares, then the first player to give three gifts to other players and return to the home square wins.However I noticed something that hit me like a ton of bricks which is why I gave it three stars. The game manufacturer totally caved into \"political \"correctness which always drives me nuts. If any one has actually seen the show, the whole point is to explain to Charlie Brown that the real meaning of Christmas is about the birth of Jesus Christ. Period. They all shout out \"Merry Christmas Charlie Brown\"! However squares you land are called \"Happy Holidays\" and the cards you draw from say \"Seasons Greeting\". NOWHERE in the game does it say \"Merry Christmas\". This lack of willingness to say \"Merry Christmas\" because they are too afraid they might \"offend\" someone is completely contrary to the message of the show. So I finished the game, but it didn\\'t leave me feeling great about playing it.',\n",

I spent $25 on this bear which is only slightly larger than a beanie baby.  It's well made and certainly recognizable as Corduroy.  Daughter was quite happy, but $25 was an obscene amount to pay for such a small bear.  It's cute, the size is indeed listed, but prepare to be milked for your money.\",\n",

It was an easy repair and now he is as good as new!

       "  'reviewText': \"I have to laugh at Amazon's rating for puzzles sometimes. There are different star factors for things like the fun of this toy and it's education value. It's a puzzle, which is great for teaching hand eye coordination and mental processes like analyzing and problem solving skills. As an education tool, puzzles are great for those things but I'm not sure I'd hand this particular puzzle to a younger kid. While the cluster of different images to this puzzle make it fun and interesting to put together, the lady in the bikini top, the guy with his butt crack showing and some of the other funny adult content may not be the best for younger audiences.I think the picture in this puzzle is a lot of fun and found the printing quality to be excellent. What I didn't think was as good as the quality of the puzzle cardboard/laminated paper and the way the pieces are cut. This leads me to one of the other star ratings for this toy- the durability. Number one, it's a puzzle so don't dump water or chocolate milk on it because it will ruin the pieces. I also found this to be a lighter weight cardboard compared to a puzzle like Ravensburger. As my husband and I were sitting around sorting out the edges, we both noticed that some of the pieces were stuck together. They were pieces that went together and when you tried to separate them, the process occasionally caused some of the layers of cardboard to flake apart. The other thing I noticed (besides the annoying white border around the entire edge of the puzzle) was there are pretty much only two puzzle piece styles. Why there isn't only two is that the edge pieces have a straight edge on one side - otherwise they would be only two types of puzzle pieces. I thought the interlocking of the pieces wasn't as good because of this very basic configuration.I really enjoyed putting this together as the image is a total blast, but because of the quality of the puzzle, I can't give this puzzle more than 3 stars.\",\n",

It comes with a star attached by a plastic string that once it is detached, is never seen again. A small patch of Velcro would really help.  I would recommend adding this before giving it to a two two year old. This is not a toy suitable for bedtime even with the accompaning storybook.  My grandsdon keeps his in a dumptruck or his bulldozer. For the price, it was a disappointment. Perhaps if it were not advertised as &#34;plush &#34; it would not have been such a letdown.

As I was ordering the books, I noticed the stuffed animal and ordered it too, even though he\\'s not usually that involved with stuffed dolls. Well, when he opened the gift, his eyes lit up and he hugged it.  That first night, he insisted on sleeping with Llama; in the middle of the night, my daughter heard him yell out, \"WOW! Llama! YAY!\" as he discovered it still next to him.  The llama is the perfect size for carrying around constantly, sleeping with, and even fitting into his toy barn and train.

       "  'reviewText': \"While it is true that it is impossible to reconcile this version of the romulans with the two previous glimpses, I must say that this version is by far my favorite. The only complaint I have is the art work. For the price, I was expecting stills from the series on glossy paper; instead, I found poorly drawn black and white (green and white actually) on plain ordinary paper. There are three books in this box set, and two full color posters the first being a map of romulan space, and the second depicting romulan uniforms and starships in full color.The first book details romulan life and culture. The Way of D'era, the romulan philosophy is interesting. We are also shown how the empire functions, its history, the structure of the Romulan star navy. There is a section on the various worlds which can be explored in Romulan space as well as Romulus and Remus.The second book gives rules for creating romulan characters, as well as guidlines for running an all romulan campaign. There are new traits and skills presented which are romulan specific. The most interesting section is scions of the empire. This section gives stats and descriptions of the movers and shakers of the empire. Included is Senator Kassus, a character whose shadow is felt in the LUG product &quot;A Fragile Peace&quot;.The third book includes two adventures. The first &quot;The Gentera Incident&quot; is an adventure for an all romulan cast. The second, &quot;Duty or Conscience&quot; is an adventure for a cast of starfleet characters. The first is a fairly well written adventure, the second deals with the Prime Directive and is fairly well done.All in all, if you want to add depth to your star trek campaign, this is a good product. If, however, you are a fan looking for further information on Romulans, stay away.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"For the devoted fans of the Romulans in Star trek we first first looked toward FASA's installment of the Romulans, then we had Diane Duane's and now we have LUG's.  This book adds yet another view on the Romulans  inconsistent with two most prevalent ones already out there, making it  impossible to reconcile the three.LUG's Romulan Core Setting breaks down  into three books.  The first one goes into mind set, government, ships,  ranks, etc... The basis on what you need to run a Romulan Campaign.  Then  their is a book on how to make a Romulan character and finally an adventure  manual.Though most Romulan devotees will find yet another view  irritating, the books do provide an coherent setting and background.  The  layout is fairly well done and there is a fairly good table of contents and  good handouts.The overall quality of work in this book is poor to fair.  If you expect good graphics and pictures you will be disapointed.  The  drawings for the most part appear to have been done by a 5 year old and add  nothing to the narratives when they appear.  Where an image could have  aided the narratives there are none.An example in the book is when it  speaks of the alien race the Romulans fought with during their 30 year  silence, as mentioned in the Series.  The book goes into alien mindset,  technology and appearance.  Yet when you look for an image of these beings  you are treated to a thick line drawing a 3rd grader might have  drawn.For the price I would have hoped that they would have gotten  someone who could have illustrated this professionally, brought the other  two authorized views in conjunction with this one and added color, maybe  photos to it.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'A must-have supplement for Last Unicorn\\'s Star Trek roleplaying game. If you\\'re running a campaign set in the Next Generation era, then this set provides information for using the Romulans in their strictly villainous role from that series.But, the Way of D\\'Era also provides enough background information on the Romulans as a people, that they can be brought into a game in a more neutral, or even protagonist position in an original Star Trek roleplaying setting.And most of the information in the Way of D\\'Era is easily converted to the CODA rules system from Decipher if that newer offering happens to be your system of choice for roleplaying in the Star Trek universe.But, as well written and virtually indispensable as the Way of D\\'Era is as a tool for using Romulans in any Star Trek roleplaying setting, I have to advise gamers to pass on it. The price-tag is offensive.For a boxed set of two thin, soft-cover books that originally retailed for closer to $20 to be priced at $300 for a new copy is simply idiotic. I often find myself shocked as to why people think they can charge $300, $400, or even $500 for an out-of-print roleplaying book - often more than people ask for a valuable piece of jewelry.Gaming is a hobby that is enjoyed by people of average middle-income. And no one who buys a roleplaying book buys it to seal it in a glass case and treat it like a museum piece, so pricing a book that has been out of print for a decade in the same price range with a 1st-issue Superman comic from the 1930s, or a 60-year old baseball card is ridiculous.People who buy gaming books buy them to use at the gaming table. And this set is great for just that - using in the course of playing a game. And yet most gamers don\\'t have between $50-$300 to shell out for a below-par, used, beat up, and heavily highlighted \"acceptable\" book.So, while The Way of D\\'Era is an excellent work, written by talented game-designers, and a perfect addition to anyone\\'s Star Trek gaming collection; the price for which it is being sold here puts it way beyond the average person\\'s means in this day and age.So - a word of advice to sellers of this title - bring your prices down. That\\'s a good way to assure that you wont have the same listing on Amazon, trying to sell the same book for 3 years.',\n",

The Personality Archetype system allows the player a quick way to define the role of his character further from his occupation in the fleet.The adventures are fine, and the guide to Sector 001 is a much needed complement for a wide look into the 24th Century Earth and solar colonies.In a nutshell, the book is an excellent reading, and the narrating material rounds up the previous and following books perfectly.\",\n",

My son played with this once and won\\'t pick it up again...not even while sick or in the car. He said it was just boring.  From a construction point, the seam that runs down the center of the map severely creases any state \"sticker\" left on the board when it\\'s closed.  So, you have to pull off all of the \"stickers\" before you put away the map or the center states will be permanently crumpled.  There is no place to really store the states unless you want to reposition each state back onto the sheet from which they originally came.  It\\'s not a bad toy.  My son just didn\\'t really like it.

       "  'reviewText': 'I bought this for my 4 year old as a Christmas present and she showed a lot of interest in it for a few weeks but finally got bored with it.  It is simply a cartoon type scene of a zoo showing pens with a few animals already in them such as a lion in one enclosure an a giraffe, elephant and bunny in others.  It comes with a big sheet of plastic animal reusable stickers in various sizes that a child can place on the zoo picture to change it around to her/his liking.  It\\'s very simple in layout but is interesting to look at.  It\\'s about 18\" wide when fully open and about 11\" in height. When closed it is very easy for a child to carry around since it has a large handle hole cut into the top of the board.  After a while some of the stickers sort of loose the ability to stay stuck and they keep falling off of the zoo board.  I kept picking them up all over the house and finally got tired of doing that and started throwing them away.I will say that it is very colorful and durable, and if you can find a way to keep up with all the stickers (lots of them) then you may find it to be a very good and somewhat educational toy for your child.  It may help with fine motor skills especially in using some of the extra small stickers (a tiny bunch of carrots for the bunnies).  I guess I should have put them in a baggie instead of trying to keep them all stuck to the inside of the board while it was folded when not being played with.  It would have been nice if it included a place/pouch or something to keep the stickers in while not in use.  If your child really loves stickers (mine have never been too crazy about stickers) then I think you child would love this toy.',\n",

They've stood up to a small amount of mouthing, but if your little one is prone to really chewing in his books and toys then I might wait a bit before introducing these, or make them for supervised play only.The ring they come with isn't very sturdy. We only use it for storage, so that's okay for us.

I had not heard of the mudpuppy brand before, but I'm looking into see what other products they make. My son is 16 months old, so these are a great toy to help him start to point out animals and make noises, as well as to learn his ABCs.  (The only watch out is that some of the animals I could not think what noises they make!) It is fun for us to go through the ring together or they are easy enough for him to manipulate that he can entertain himself by using them on his own. Given his age, a lot of things still end up in his mouth, including these cards. They have held up very well and aren't completely destroyed! The designs are very cute and this is something that I can see us getting a lot of use out of for the next year or two.  I liked them so much, I ordered another ring for an upcoming trip---they seem like a great plane ride activity.Also, I would highly recommend getting theSecure-A-Toy, BLACK-WHITEto go with this. I used this to strap the rings to the carseat and the stroller, so he can thumb through the cards on his own, but not lose them if he decides to throw them. If you have not used these in general, I highly suggest, as I've found a ton of uses over the last few weeks...they're especially great when traveling.\",\n",

Metallic shapes excellent for stickability but smaller shapes get lost easily so beware!Screams can result.The shapes only adhere to metal box lids so this means taking them out and laying them on a table,while putting the sets inside the box.luckily there are two ballerinas (one for practicing,one for dancing on a stage).There is plenty of opportunity for fun ideas, better for the practice set than for the stage.Kids can shut the box up and still keep everything inside and carry it around so it is very practical. Educationally let's kids decide,choose outfits, try out ideas, and work with someone else as well so quite social fun.Lots of conversation.Occupies them for a time so is worth giving to a child..they will love it then get bored eventually I guess because there are only so many choices.Mudpuppy Ballerinas Magnetic Figures\",\n",

I like the chunky blocks, and since they are multi-sided there are 6 different puzzles to create.  They come in an easy-to-store box and the blocks are sized right for kids' hands.  The only negative thing I can say is that I thought the blocks would be made out of wood, but instead they are made out of cardboard and the paper images are glued on.  It's possible that the paper could get torn at the edges over time.

I don't have any children but my refridgerator loves the magnets.It's always neat to walk into the kitchen and be surprised by the creations that friends and visiting house guests come up with. However, be warned: it's equally irritating to find that somebody messed with your fantastic monster setup after you spent seven whole minutes getting your Dr. Frankenstein on.

       "  'reviewText': \"Teaching kids about money is important, yet personal finance is often neglected and few parents take the time to start the educational process. Many excuses are given, but it is important to start this education while kids are young and the Mudpuppy Ballerina Money Bank is a good place to start. This bank does more than just encourage kids to save money- it also helps to develop a sense of charity and frugality.How does this bank accomplish so much? It does this through its modified design, which includes three different slots: One for Spend; one for Save; and one for Share. When money is dropped into one of the three slots, it is collected in a separate chamber. This separation and the three different options help to teach kids about saving for the future, saving money for a large purchase, and sharing money with others.What I like most about this bank is that it encourages kids to think about the different uses for money and the importance of giving. It is a simple design and concept and the three different slots and labels encourage kids to ask questions. It sparks their curiosity and gets them thinking about money, different ways to save, charity, etc. It shows kids that there is much more to money than simply spending it today and hoping for more tomorrow.As for cons, I can think of only a few issues with this bank and the main issue I have is with the physical size. The bank is only about 4.5 inches in diameter and the individual chambers will fill up in no time. This could discourage some kids to save more money. Once a chamber is full, some kids will immediately want to empty the compartment and use the money. I am also not too sure about the small padlock. Unless a child has untrustworthy siblings, I don't think a lock is necessary. Not only that, but the lock is small and the keys are tiny- It would be very easy to accidentally lose these keys.Financial education is important and the Mudpuppy Ballerina Money Bank is a simple yet effective device for teaching kids the value of a dollar. It would be nice if it was a little bit larger, but it is still a good savings bank and its educational value goes far beyond the basics.\",\n",

I would recommend keeping this up on a shelf if there are younger children around who may not use a gentle touch with this - 1) because there could be coins inside (choking hazard) and 2) it is not something to be played with.

My hope of moving some robots to the fridge just can't happen. I find this whole set visually frustrating too as the pieces and backgrounds are extremely busy.

The cardboard pieces may be advertised as \"sturdy laminated paper on board construction\" but they rip easily. Very easily, even with gentle and proper play by age-appropriate children. Also, the scale of the pieces is smaller than you might think.We purchased ours through Land of Nod but it is the same exact Painter\\'s Palette set. I have not yet asked the manufacturer (Mudpuppy) for a replacement but will be sure to update any resolution here if I do.*I will rate 2 stars because somehow the kids still play with this--even though almost all of the pieces have been broken in half, there are still some slots for fitting together--and because encouraging creative building is to be commended. But ultimately, and if I had it to do over again, I would have purchased the similar-in-concept but better-in-execution set from Pottery Barn Kids. It was made of wood and larger in scale, and cost (I think) forty-nine dollars.* UPDATE *September 22The company sent me a refund check even though I said more than once that I would be happy to receive the \"new and improved\" set. My guess is they knew the new set would break just as easily (if there even *is* a new set). Still, I appreciate the refund. But I wouldn\\'t recommend this product.September 15I have spoken with the President of the company and am sending some representative broken pieces to him for their production team to review.

It's a good size, not made up of thin pieces, has a picture on each side, and is just plain cool. I don't know what some other people are saying regarding it not being durable- ours is just fine and isn't wearing away at all, even almost a year after buying it. The only thing bad I can say about it has to do with the box, and that's not exactly why you're buying this.One side of the puzzle shows Max, Moishe and Bernard as he leads them in their wild rumpusing. The other side is the image from the cover of the book, with Bernard asleep while Max's boat sails in the background. The images are supposed to be 'awake' and 'asleep', to teach your child opposites. I guess it does its job well, though I would've went with the image of Aaron and the big nosed Wild Thing sleeping for the asleep image, but that's just me. This puzzle is still good.9 pieces of thick puzzle pieces, not the sissy thin ones you get on 95% of puzzles out there. They come in a colorful box with a small rope to carry it around. The box breaks apart very easily, so you might want to either take good care of it, or just put the pieces somewhere else and get rid of it.My daughter was able to do this puzzle at a little under 2 and a half, so any child 3 or up should have no problems doing it.\",\n",

It comes packaged in a sturdy plastic envelope with resealable closure, and consists of a play board with 2 sheets of vinyl stickers whose prints do not seem to wear out. May I suggest you hold onto the sticker sheets but remove the vinyl sticker borders that\\'s not needed, so you can place unused stickers at random for easy transport because the kit does not come with a storage for unused stickers. My 21 month old absolutely looks forward to this every day that I have to save the activity for a treat after I\\'ve gotten him to clear his toys and other little chores. A month ago when he first got this he used to place stickers completely at random sometimes atop each other but the more we play the more aware he has become of the background scene and purpose that he pays attention to which side up he\\'s sticking and can create fun scenes like the giant octopus tackling a pirate. Sometimes he attempts to describe the scene, like pointing to the peg-legged pirate and saying \"no more leg\".

The quality of the cardboard is fairly good; it seems to be lamintated, although ours are starting to wear on the edges.  The colors are very vibrant -- much more so than other flash cards we have.  Even though the other reviewer is right -- the ring doesn't stay closed -- I still give this product 5 stars because the pictures are adorable, the cardboard fairly sturdy, and the images are creative and clearly depict the opposites (where other opposite books/cards have failed).  If you're going to give it to a baby in a carseat or plane, I would buy a stronger ring (or reinforce it with a string or something) because it is pretty easy to unlock.  We like to sort them, count them, etc. out of the ring too.  I really love these and added some photos to help in your decision. :)\",\n",

We have a few of the smaller puzzles (Goodnight Moon and the Zoo one) which are both great, too.  I got this because our three year-old is ready for more challenging puzzles.

       "  'reviewText': 'I\\'m puzzled by the strongly negative reviews of this item. Indeed it is cardboard, but a very thick, heavy type that seems extremely sturdy. We\\'ve had this bank for about 8 months and it has been great. It\\'s withstanding the amount of use it gets (putting money in regularly and opening and closing it a couple times a month), the design looks cute in my child\\'s room, and it is perfectly functional as a bank w/3 compartments. Obviously it\\'s not going to last forever, but it makes an excellent \"first bank\" and the price is less than the plastic banks of similar design. Actually, considering the way technology is going, kids aren\\'t going to walk around with piles of change the way they used to b/c everything is going electronic anyway, so I figure we\\'ll probably end up going straight from this to a wallet.The only complaint I have about it is that after 6 mos. or so of use, the lock got stuck and we couldn\\'t get it open with the key anymore, so we had to cut it off--but I just put one of those tiny luggage locks on it instead, which fit perfectly (you know, those ones I think the airlines don\\'t even allow anymore, so I have a bunch of them w/matching keys that my kids love to play with).Anyway, my son thinks the lock is really fun and was also excited to have his own keychain and key that he keeps hidden in a drawer away from his little sister. ;)I love that it has the 3 compartments; this has really encouraged my child to save and give some of his funds. He recently decided he\\'s going to put a portion in his give compartment until he can buy a particular gift for a friend.The designs are SO cute, much more attractive than the other products that have a 3 compartment design. This was the main reason I chose it over the others. And it\\'s nice that it comes in different designs b/c I also plan to get one of these for my other child when she reaches allowance age, so they can feel that it\\'s a personal gift and also tell them apart easily.',\n",

I like it better than the other options on the market, anyway, so I guess that makes it worth it. It's tough enough for my four year old to handle with no issues at all. I love the three sections. The dividers come up to where the lid meets the body, so it's plenty of space for money to be kept separate.If the bank falls over, change could become co-mingled. That's not much of an issue for us since our son won't be playing with the bank--just adding money from time to time.We ordered the garden one for our niece and the robot one for my son.

My one year old son like them, and is able to take the on and off the fridge.They are not water safe, meaning no chewing and no washing (even with a damp rag I would be worried).  The colorful tops are just a layer of coated paper, but after a quick washing to get the extra flecks of magnet and wood off them, the paper started to peel up.  I glued them back down, only one got ripped but now I know, no washing or chewing.  Meaning they can only be used with close supervision of a one year one.  Annoying but not impossible.Also the letter C and I are too small, I consider them a choking hazard at this age. Not a problem for now we just have his name on the fridge, its enough - easier to keep track of.Would I buy again?  Maybe.  They are made in china, boo. But they are wooden (pressed) and not from M&D; (yeah!).  I would probably try to find something more waterproof (design painted on instead of paper) first, but if I was unsuccessful I very well may buy again.',\n",

I recommend ordering 2 sets so you can have doubles of every letter vs just the extra few they give you of certain letters.These magnets look great on my fridge. As far as the other reviewer's comment regarding the product not being water proof/drool proof because of the paper- I figure if and when the paper wears off it'll be a fun project for my LO & I to paint these wooden numbers with non-toxic paint. But I don't see that happening in the near future. They seem very well made and sturdy and it's very difficult to even tell there is paper on them instead of paint.  Great alternative to the ugly cheap plastic magnets that are no good for our babies nor the environment!I am very pleased and recommend this set to everyone. For this price, these are a steal in my opinion. Rest assured you are getting a great product.\",\n",

This is, by the way, an activity I highly recommend. We stumbled on the observation that these numbers (and the Melissa and Doug letters) can be used to stamp the Magna Doodle, and for a while that was pretty much all my son wanted to do with his time. He is almost 3, and well ahead on reading and math, and I think that this stamping activity had something to do with his speed. I should say that the paper covering on the numbers does wear off fast, but then these numbers get a lot of use. Also there are three of each number (because the set allows you to model simple equations), so even if your kids loses numbers like mine does it takes a while before you run out. I probably bought my first box a year and a half ago, and I haven't opened the fourth box yet, so keeping my son in numbers is costing me about $50 a year. I originally bought  a plainer box from the same company - I had some idea that all the shapes ON this brightly patterned set would distract him from the shape of the number itself - and then I switched to this far cuter set once he knew his numbers.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'Based on many positive reviews, I bought this puzzle for my two year old daughter (The recommended age for this puzzle is 3-5yrs old, but my daughter has been putting together 60 piece puzzle by herself, so I thought this would be appropriate for her) The puzzle is very beautiful, but I was disappointed in the way the puzzle pieces are cut.  When you pick up the pieces, many times there are no way to tell what you are holding, so you have to go by the shape rather than the picture to put it together.  Eg. one piece has just a colorful dot - with just this information, you cannot visually look for the next piece since it is not a continuation of a picture. You either have to consult the picture on the box to see which dot comes next, or try out each piece until you happen to come across the shape that fits the piece (which is my daughter\\'s method).Similarly, the body part of the caterpillar is cut in such a way that you are looking at a green puzzle piece that all looks similar except for the different cut. No way to tell whether you are holding the caterpillar\\'s neck, back, tail or the belly. So the way to complete this puzzle is mainly to work from the corner/side and find the pieces that fit each other by shapes.  While my daughter can complete the puzzle, this is not my (nor my daughter\\'s) favorite.  I prefer puzzle pieces that when you pick up, you can tell what part of the picture you are holding and visually look for the next piece.PROS:- Beautiful shiny surface with brilliant color- Nice thick cardboard pieces (about 2mm thick) that is durable but not hard to put together or pull apartCONS:- Abstract picture.  Except for the face of the caterpillar and the fruits, you have to put the puzzle together by the shape rather than the picture.I bought this puzzle a little cheaper at Barnes & Nobles for $11.95 (instead of the current Amazon price of $15.99).I have bought puzzles by Ravensburger, Melissa & Doug, Mudpuppy and Kumon but our all time favorite is Briarpatch\\'s \"The Good Night Moon\" puzzle.',\n",

The pieces are a nice size for small hands, about 3'x3' (measuring as if the piece were a full square).  They are made of cardboard, but it is thick and stiff, it does not bend easily like some other cheaper puzzles we own.  The puzzle has been worked many times over the last few months by my toddler and so far shows no signs of wear and tear.  It has a nice shiny / slick surface which I imagine can be cleaned up fairly easily if needed.

Our boys have taken well to the idea and are happy to \"spread\" the funds around.  It also gives us the opportunity to talk to them about their current thoughts about saving and giving whenever we access the banks.One of the banks would not open as the clasp was stuck somehow.

It was one of their favorite bedtime stories (before they saw an Ipad), so they\\'re very familiar with the scene on this puzzle.  They got the puzzle as a gift when they were on the young end of three, along with theMudpuppy Eric Carle Caterpillar 42 Piece Puzzle(another favorite).  I admit, at the time, I thought it was too hard for them, but one of my daughters found it fascinating and regularly asks to have us help her with it.  Now that she\\'s almost four she still asks for help, but only to be social: she can actually do the entire thing on her own.This is a good puzzle for young children expanding past the simple wooden puzzles offered to toddlers.  The pieces are sturdy and large.  If they\\'ve read the book as much as my kids have, they already know the picture and can do it with minimum consultation of the box picture.  The completed size of the puzzle is just right: not too big and not too small.  We usually work on it on the floor, and since the pieces are large enough they don\\'t require a hard surface to fit nicely.  It\\'s a good puzzle and I recommend it for kids getting interested in \"big kid\" puzzles.',\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'Bought these for my daughter who is having a hard time with distinguishing colors from the Pantone book she got for Christmas.  My husband thought it might be because the Pantone pages show about 20 different variations on the color (cherry red, tomato red, burgundy red, wine red) etc. and he thought it might be better to just have ONE color to represent the concept (just cherry red for red) and that that might be the issue.  These cards looked well made and since my girls had destroyed a \"heavy cardstock\" style of flash cards before, they were the best option.  The ring is plastic, and one set (this one) the ring stays together better than the other set (the ABCs one).  A drop of super glue should fix that.  The cards are very heavy cardboard, and have a glossy sheen on them, which makes them easy to clean up (wipe off food...) and also easy for the girls to turn the cards (2.5 and 4 yr old).  The quality is high in my opinion.  the words are easy to read, and the shapes are easy to distinguish for the most part.  The bunny with the square tooth was odd in my opinion - I get it, but the square was very small.  It does help them identify the shapes in real world settings, but I was looking for something more basic than that.  My only complaint on the set is that for the colors the front side has it on the animal (for example, the blue elephant, since that\\'s the pic you see on this page), but it is set in the solid color background (purple).  When you turn the card over, it shows you the color \"blue\" in a circle, but the background of that page isn\\'t blue, it is purple.  So when you ask a 2.5 yr old what color that is, half the time she says purple, half the time blue.  I\\'d have preferred the whole back side of the card be the identifying color \"blue\".  The ironic part is that the shape cards are this way - the back is the same color inside the shape as outside it, so I may end up using those to identify colors as well as shapes, since there won\\'t be any confusion as to which part I\\'m asking her to identify.  All in all, I\\'d buy them again, but they certainly weren\\'t exactly what I was looking for in terms of a more straightforward approach than the pantone books. Well made though, and great for older (4-5 yr old) kids!',\n",

We have an 18 month old who grabs the pieces and isnt very gentle and still all ive noticed is a slight bend in one piece. Although the puzzle says 6+ i found that after a couple of times helping my 4 yr old she was excited to try doing it by herself. She does ask for help every once in awhile, i just remind her to use the pictures as clues and the flat edges go on the outside and she is able to continue without me. Its pretty amazing, she will sit and work on this puzzle for 20 minutes quietly, finish, I will dole out several high-fives, and then she takes it apart and starts over. Im so happy she got this puzzle and I will definitely buy her more from this brand. You cant go wrong. The under water sea life puzzle & the landmarks of the world are on our wish list!',\n",

She has to think about it and once in a while will ask for help but she enjoys figuring it out and doesn't get too frustrated. This particular brand of puzzle is very well constructed and I love the circular box! It is perfect for storing the pieces when not in use.

       "  'reviewText': \"We like this puzzle, the pictures are nice and it is not as hard as some of the other similar puzzles we have tried. The only negatives are related to construction quality. For the price I was expecting wood blocks, but these are a light cardboard with stickers often sloppily placed on each side. One thing that I really like is that the blocks are always going to be in the same position when assembling the puzzle, meaning that my toddler can quickly just flip to do all of them at once after solving the first one. We also like the colored border which makes finding the right side to use much easier. The box it comes in is nice enough to use for storage, but ours was ripped pretty quickly by my son trying to slide the puzzle back in all by himself. Still works though, just doesn't look great.

       "  'reviewText': \"We received this puzzle as a present for my daughter's 2nd birthday.  It was a hit from the moment we got it.  My daughter loved the little plastic pouch, and enjoyed scribbling with crayons on the back of the surprisingly-sturdy puzzle pieces.  She's almost 3 now, and she has just recently started going the puzzle all by herself!  She often took it out of the package and laid the pieces on the floor to play with, but never really figured out what to do from there.  The other morning, she spontaneously pulled the puzzle out of the toy chest and did the entire thing!  She was so proud of herself, and has done it several times since, clapping with delight every time she gets the pieces to fit together properly.  Once assembled, she loves to talk about the picture itself and all the fun things going on in it.  This is really a perfect first puzzle for a toddler.My one-year-old recently decided to use a piece as a teether, however, and it is not a good teether.  A few minutes in his mouth and the piece disintegrated in the corner where he was chewing on it.  Fortunately, I rescued it in time and my daughter can still do the puzzle.  But if your kid is a big mouther, don't give it to them yet.  Now we keep puzzle time away from the little brother.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'My toddler recently became interested in a kids jigsaw puzzle app on our iPad but was having trouble dragging the pieces into place on the tablet. So we bought this one as a physical puzzle for her to practice spatial pattern recognition. The pieces are big and the puzzle picture image is well chosen for few redundant elements and enough different colored objects. The pieces are nicely divided up so each one has a distinct image that can be easily identified within the overall picture. My daughter still struggles to get all the correct pieces in place but it is easy to explain how the bit with the black and white is part of the cow, the pink is the pig and so on. The edge pieces have a purple flowered border so we can show her to start with those to map out the boundary.My only quibble is that if the cardboard gets wet, the backing will peel off and the piece becomes essentially useless - so if your toddler likes to sprinkle her toys with her sippy cup like ours does, that will reduce the durability of this toy. But all in all, this is an excellent starter jigsaw puzzle.',\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"(This is nearly the same review I'm giving under the butterfly puzzle in case you already read those and read my review there.)My 28-month-old daughter got this for Christmas and has been playing with this and her other puzzles regularly since.  She already was a puzzle lover, but we needed to find some that were a little more challenging for her than just the 2 or 3 piece matching ones, but not overly difficult for her either.  She can't yet do this one fully one her own, but it does engage her if we sit with her and she loves the challenge and resists our help as long as possible.  She loves this and the butterfly puzzle we got her from the same brand.  We will definitely buy her the other other puzzles (sea life and dinosaurs) that I've seen here as well.The puzzle pieces are not AS durable as some of her wooden puzzles, but still plenty strong, and much better than your typical cardboard jigsaw you find.  I can't decide if I like the re-usable pouch or not.  In some ways, I like that it is less bulky than some of the wooden boxes/frames that her other puzzles come in, especially while she is doing the puzzle, but it also feels like it won't last as long (though still quite durable itself).  It seems less stack able or organized when we're putting her puzzles and toys away as well, but that's minor and not worth taking stars away from my rating in my opinion (again, I see both pros and cons, just trying to give all my thoughts here in case people are wondering).I like that she can easily put the pig together, then the cow, and then the barn, and then she kind of brings it all together after that.  It definitely is helping her think about how things work and fit together and keeps her engaged for quite a while.  Since I often appreciate getting other good/similar recommendations from other reviewers, I will say that we also got her the Melissa and Doug puzzles where they come with a box with 4 different (smaller but still 12 pieces) puzzles in each box.  Those are probably our favorites as she can do those completely on her own, the puzzles themselves take up a little less space, I like the clean organization of the boxes to keep them in, and the little wooden pieces are just a bit more durable.  That all said, I will gladly continue to buy her more of those and these puzzles for good variety as she loves puzzles and I am happy they keep her quietly occupied in a contained area for a while and learning how to think and strategize a bit too!\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"I am so delighted with these flashcards. I had not heard of the mudpuppy brand before, but I'm looking into see what other products they make. My son is 16 months old, so these are a great toy to help him start to point out recognizable objects and start using his words.  It is fun for us to go through the ring together or they are easy enough for him to manipulate that he can entertain himself by using them on his own. Given his age, a lot of things still end up in his mouth, including these cards. They have held up very well and aren't completely destroyed! The designs are very cute and this is something that I can see us getting a lot of use out of for the next year or two.  I liked them so much, I ordered another ring for an upcoming trip---they seem like a great plane ride activity.Also, I would highly recommend getting theSecure-A-Toy, BLACK-WHITEto go with this. I used this to strap the rings to the carseat and the stroller, so he can thumb through the cards on his own, but not lose them if he decides to throw them. If you have not used these in general, I highly suggest, as I've found a ton of uses over the last few weeks...they're especially great when traveling.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"(This is nearly the same review I'm giving under the similar farm puzzle in case you already read those and read my review there.)My 28-month-old daughter got this for Christmas and has been playing with this and her other puzzles regularly since.  She already was a puzzle lover, but we needed to find some that were a little more challenging for her than just the 2 or 3 piece matching ones, but not overly difficult for her either.She can't yet do this one fully one her own, but it does engage her if we sit with her and she loves the challenge and resists our help as long as possible.  She loves this and the MudPuppy farm puzzle she got as well.  We will definitely buy her the other other puzzles (sea life and dinosaurs) that I've seen of theirs.The puzzle pieces are not as durable as some of her wooden puzzles, but still plenty strong, and much better than your typical cardboard jigsaw you find.I can't decide if I like the re-usable pouch or not.  In some ways, I like that it is less bulky than some of the wooden boxes/frames that her other puzzles come in, especially while she is doing the puzzle, but it also feels like it won't last as long (though still quite durable itself).  It's less stack-able or seemingly less organized then when we're putting her puzzles and toys away, but that's minor and not worth taking stars away from my rating in my opinion (again, I see both pros and cons, just trying to give all my thoughts here in case people are wondering).This one is a little tougher than the farm puzzle as there are more similar colors and it's all butterflies/insects vs. the variety of the cow, pig, barn in the farm puzzle so she definitely struggles a bit more with this one and is more likely to ask for help or give up, but I think she'll be doing it on her own in the next few months.  They definitely help her think about how things work and fit together and keep her engaged for quite a while.Since I often appreciate getting other good/similar recommendations from other reviewers, I will say that we also got her the Melissa and Doug puzzles where they come with a box with 4 different (smaller but still 12 pieces) puzzles in each box.  Those are probably our favorites as she can do those completely on her own, the puzzles themselves take up a little less space, I like the clean organization of the boxes to keep them in, and the little wooden pieces are just a bit more durable.  That all said, I will gladly continue to buy her more of those and these puzzles for good variety as she loves puzzles and I am happy they keep her quietly occupied in a contained area for a while and learning how to think and strategize a bit too!\",\n",

This was her first 'big girl' puzzle (ie, first jigsaw puzzle) - it took her a little bit to figure it out but now she's mastered it and can put it together very quickly.  (Note, this doesn't seem to have diminished her enjoyment of it though - it lives on our kitchen floor because every time I put it away she just takes it out again!)  She's learned about all of the creatures shown in the pics too - so we've added 'seahorse' and 'starfish' to her ever-expanding vocabulary :) It's very brightly colored, and very durable.  The pouch was not as durable as I'd hoped, but I reinforced all of the edges with clear packing tape which is working just fine.

The kids can decorate with sticker or crayons or markers to personalize it a bit and I can help with a quick note (my kid's are still in preschool and K) instead of overseeing an entire project. I am not giving this 5 stars because had I put enough of my own thought into it I would have just purchased some completely blank muti-colored cards and thank you stickers, etc for them to use for much less, but all and all it serves its purpose of teaching them the importance of showing thanks so I am happy with the purchase.\",\n",

It basically consists of good quality magnetic dinosaur parts, poor quality scenes and a below average quality tin box. Basically the child lays a scene sheet (thin paper with double-sided printing coated with a glossy wax layer on both sides) on the inside of the tin and assembles the dinosaur pieces on it. Each of the 2 sheets crumple easily and don't look durable for destructive kids. Mine crumpled on first use. I generally love Mudpuppy products but feel this magnetic series could have been better designed with the scenes made magnetic so that each side may hold pieces from a different dinosaur. Right now, because the scenes are not magnetic and that the tin is pretty small, the magnetic dinosaur parts have to be jumbled together as not every piece is able to fit on the tin and makes it so time consuming to sort out which parts belong to which dinosaur. Hopefully your kids are patient unlike mine.\",\n",

My kiddo loves letting the pets roam around the yard and check out all the features she places, which leads me to think she'd really love more living creatures to inhabit these places. This would be a great travel toy because you can't play with it unless it's in the box. Everything sticks in there. The one gripe I have is that it looks like there are 4 different cards to play with, but there are only 2 cards front and back, and they all fit inside the box, so you can only really look at one at a time, 2 cards max if you spread it out on another magnetic surface like a fridge.

It is a lot of fun to play with either on your own or with someone else - trying to architect the house together.  This one and the cupcake/bakery set are really both adorable - and my daughter has sustained an interest in both for a long time.  We've had the bakery one for over a year, and although we've lost many of the magnets, she returns to it all the time.  (I just bought this house one recently, but I assume it will be a similar fascination).  One thing I will say - having had the cupcake one for a while - the box did eventually dent, and with both of the sets, I've found it a little frustrating trying to get the cards out of the box (as they stick in there really well)... my daughter is actually better at removing them than I am (!!!), and I'll note the company who made it was very thoughtful in scalloping the bottom to make it easier.  The magnets are pretty strong.  I really do recommend this - especially to bring to restaurants or on a plane (or maybe for an older kid, the car - but I know we would lose the pieces if I gave it to my 3 year old while driving!).
